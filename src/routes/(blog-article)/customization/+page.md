In general, content can be modified by editing the **organisms** and the pages themselves. By 'Molecular Design' principle, organisms is the top level displayed object. You can imagine it as the 'general layout' of each blog post. It completely supports Markdown language, so you can edit your blog posts with ease!

## Wait. What is 'Markdown' ? What is .md extension files?

It is a quite easy way to manage your text in a beatiful and universal manner! I highly recommend watching this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPWWRV6gbA ! This is a very short & precise tutorial, but it covers all the markdown language principles. You can also search everything about .md files as there are tons of material for it on the web. Don't let this overwhelm you, as I guarantee if you try to learn it for just 2-3 hours googling, you'll be able to write .md markdown files in no-time! ðŸ˜‰
