## I can also show photos?

You absolutely can! This might be a little bit more tricky than blog posts, but I can also help you out anytime you want. After you get the grasp of .md markdown files, you can add photos yourself! Maybe in the future, I also can implement a basic user interface just for you, and you can log in with your credientals and upload your photos there. Photos will automatically appear on your website! Here's how photos look here:
